The company produces cars, trucks, vans, and buses.[7]\\nSubsidiaries include British Jaguar Land Rover and South Korean Tata Daewoo. Tata Motors has joint ventures with Hitachi (Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery) and Stellantis, which makes vehicle parts for Fiat Chrysler and Tata-branded vehicles.\\nTata Motors has auto manufacturing and vehicle plants in Jamshedpur, Pantnagar, Lucknow, Sanand, Dharwad, and Pune in India, as well as in Argentina, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. It has research and development centers in Pune, Jamshedpur, Lucknow, Dharwad, India and South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Spain. Tata Motors is listed on the BSE and NSE, and is a constituent of the BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 benchmark indices. The company is ranked 265th on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world\\'s biggest corporations as of 2019.[8]\\nOn 17 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the company Tata Group. Tata Motors increased its UV market share to over 8% in FY2019.[9]\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nTata Sierra (1991-2000)\\nTata Sumo (1994â€“2019)\\nTata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[10] By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100Â\\xa0hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.[11] After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).[citation needed]\\n\\nTata Indica (first generation)\\nTata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.[12]\\nIn the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo\\'s South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit,[13] a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,[14] Jaguar Land Rover.,[15][16][17][18] Hispano Carrocera,[19] and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.[20]\\nOn 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors\\' electric vehicle subsidiary.[21]\\n\\nOperations[edit]\\nTata Motors has vehicle assembly operations in India, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Spain, and South Africa.

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata\\'s dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo\\'s strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.\\nTata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus. In 2012, Tata began developing a new line to manufacture competitive and fuel-efficient commercial vehicles to face the competition posed by the entry of international brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Navistar into the Indian market.[33]\\n\\nTata Hispano[edit]\\n\\nTata Hispano Motors Carrocera, S.A. was a bus and coach manufacturer based in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. Tata Hispano has plants in Zaragoza, Spain, and Casablanca, Morocco.

The editors cited \"electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks\" as problematic aspects.[43]\\nThe Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business. The company ruled out the possibility of a sale of JLR to another entity.[44]\\nIn July 2023, Tata announced its plans to invest Â£4 billion to build an electric car battery factory in the UK, which will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe.[45][46][47] The factory will be the company\\'s first battery production facility outside India.[47] Located in Bridgwater, Somerset, the factory will supply Jaguar Land Rover\\'s future battery electric models, including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar brands, with the potential to also supply other car manufacturers.[36] Production at the new facility is due to start in 2026.\\n\\nJoint ventures[edit]\\nTata Marcopolo[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Marcopolo bus in use in Chandigarh, India\\nTata Marcopolo is a bus-manufacturing joint venture between Tata Motors (51%) and the Brazil-based Marcopolo S.A. (49%). The joint venture manufactures and assembles fully built buses and coaches targeted at developing mass rapid transportation systems.

Tata Marcopolo has launched a low-floor city bus which is widely used by transport corporations in many Indian cities. Its manufacturing facility is based in Dharwad, Karnataka State, India and Lucknow, India.\\nTata Motors is expected to buy the 49% stake held by its partner Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for â‚¹100 crore by February 2021. The subsidiary will continue with the â€˜Marcopoloâ€™ trademark for a minimum of three years with a non-compete provision in India for a corresponding period.[48]\\n\\nFiat-Tata[edit]\\nFiat-Tata is an India-based joint venture between Tata and Stellantis\\' Fiat which produces Fiat and Tata branded passenger cars, as well as engines and transmissions. Tata Motors has gained access to Fiat\\'s diesel engine and transmission technology through the joint venture.[49]\\nThe two companies formerly also had a distribution joint venture through which Fiat products were sold in India through joint Tata-Fiat dealerships. This distribution arrangement was ended in March 2013; Fiats have since been distributed in India by Fiat Automobiles India Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat[50][51] and now Tata Motors.\\n\\nTata Hitachi Construction Machinery[edit]\\n\\nTata Hitachi Construction Machinery is a joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi which manufactures excavators and other construction equipment.[citation needed] It was previously known as Telcon Construction Solutions.[citation needed]\\n\\nTata Motors European Technical Centre[edit]\\nThe TATA Motors European Technical Centre is an automotive design, engineering, and research company.[citation needed] Company based at WMG, University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] It was established in 2005 and is wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors.

These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India.\\nIn December 2019, Tata Motors unveiled the Nexon EV, an SUV with a 30.2KWh lithium-ion battery and a consistent range of 312Â\\xa0km on a single charge. It is also equipped with fast charging technology, which can charge the vehicle from 0% - 80% in 60 minutes.[60] With 525 units of Nexon EV sold in India last month, Tata Nexon EV[61] was the best-selling electric car in the month of April 2021 in India.\\nTata Passenger Electric Mobility is a subsidiary which produces electric cars under the brand name Tata Motors.[62]\\nList of Tata electric vehicles:\\n\\nTata Nexon EV\\nTata Tigor EV\\nTata Altroz EV\\nTata Tiago EV\\nTata Ace EV\\nTata Punch EV[63]\\nElectric Vehicle Concepts[edit]\\nTata Curvv\\nTata Avinya\\nTata EVision\\nHarrier.ev\\nSierra.ev[64]\\nDiscontinued Models[edit]\\nTata Telcoline (1988â€“2010)\\nTata Sierra (1991â€“2003)\\nTata Estate (1992â€“2000)\\nTata Sumo (1994â€“2019)\\nTata Indica (1998â€“2015)\\nTata Spacio (2000-2011)\\nTata Indigo (2002â€“2015)\\nTata Indigo Marina (2006â€“2009)\\nTata Xenon (2007â€“2018)\\nTata Sumo Grande (2008â€“2016)\\nTata Vista (2008â€“2015)\\nTata Nano (2008â€“2018)\\nTata Manza (2011â€“2016)[65]\\nTata Venture (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Aria (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Zest (2014â€“2020)\\nTata Bolt (2014â€“2019)\\nTata Hexa (2017â€“2020)\\nNotable vehicles[edit]\\nTata Nano[edit]\\n\\nTata Nano is often cited as the world\\'s most affordable car\\nThe Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at â‚¹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety[66][67] and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[68]\\n\\nTata Ace[edit]\\n\\nTata Super Ace\\nTata Ace, India\\'s first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle  (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle  segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport.\\nBy October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[69]\\nBy 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[70] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[71] Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries\\' Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.\\n\\nTata Prima[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Prima 4928.S in Assam, India\\nTata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company\\'s \\'global\\' truck.

The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.[73]\\n\\nTata Harrier[edit]\\n\\nTata Harrier\\nTata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass. This car uses the engine from Fiat which is a 2.0 L-4 cylinder turbocharged diesel motor and transmission from Hyundai which is a 6-speed, available in both manual and automatic. Tata Harrier is derived from the H5X Concept displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo. It was launched on 23 January 2019.[74]\\nThe car is a C-segment crossover SUV based on the OmegaArc platform, an essentially re-engineered version of the Jaguar Land Rover D8 platform.[75] A petrol variant of the Harrier is confirmed to launch in 2022â€“23.[76]\\nTata Harrier is also available in Nepal with the name H5.\\n\\nTata Nexon[edit]\\n\\nTata Nexon\\nThe Tata Nexon is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Tata Motors since 2017. It is the first crossover SUV from Tata Motors, and occupies the sub-4 metre crossover SUV segment in India.[77] The electric version of the Nexon was revealed on 19 December 2019. The Nexon EV uses components from Tata Motors\\' electric vehicle technology brand Ziptron. The electric motor produces 94.7Â\\xa0kW (127Â\\xa0hp; 129Â\\xa0PS) and 245Â\\xa0Nâ‹…m (181Â\\xa0lbfâ‹…ft) of torque and 0 - 100 under 9.9 seconds. It has a 30.2 kWh battery with an ARAI rated range of up to 312Â\\xa0km.[78]\\nThe battery can be fully charged in under 8 hours using a complimentary AC charger. It can also be charged using a 15-ampere power cable that can be used at any place with the necessary power socket. DC 25Â\\xa0kW fast charging can be used to charge the battery from 0 to 80% in 1 hour.[79]\\n\\nRestructuring[edit]\\nIn March 2024, Tata Motors announced plans to undergo a significant restructuring by splitting into two separate listed entities. This strategic move aims to enhance operational efficiencies and focus on distinct business segments. The demerger is expected to allow each entity to pursue tailored growth strategies and attract specific investor bases. The announcement was well-received by the market, with Tata Motors\\' stock experiencing a notable jump following the news.[80][81][82]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of companies of India\\nList of largest companies by revenue\\nList of corporations by market capitalisation\\nMake in India\\nForbes Global 2000\\nFortune India 500\\nAutomotive industry in India\\nTata Revotron engine\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Contact Us - Tata Motors Limited\". www.tatamotors.com. 14 October 2015.

The company is ranked 265th on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world\\'s biggest corporations as of 2019.[8]\\nOn 17 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the company Tata Group. Tata Motors increased its UV market share to over 8% in FY2019.[9]\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nTata Sierra (1991-2000)\\nTata Sumo (1994â€“2019)\\nTata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[10] By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100Â\\xa0hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.[11] After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).[citation needed]\\n\\nTata Indica (first generation)\\nTata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.[12]\\nIn the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo\\'s South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit,[13] a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,[14] Jaguar Land Rover.,[15][16][17][18] Hispano Carrocera,[19] and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.[20]\\nOn 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors\\' electric vehicle subsidiary.[21]\\n\\nOperations[edit]\\nTata Motors has vehicle assembly operations in India, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Spain, and South Africa. It plans to establish plants in Turkey, Indonesia, and Eastern Europe.\\n\\nTata Motors Cars[edit]\\n\\nTata Motors Cars is a division of Tata Motors which produces passenger cars under the Tata Motors hood.

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata\\'s dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo\\'s strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.\\nTata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus. In 2012, Tata began developing a new line to manufacture competitive and fuel-efficient commercial vehicles to face the competition posed by the entry of international brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Navistar into the Indian market.[33]\\n\\nTata Hispano[edit]\\n\\nTata Hispano Motors Carrocera, S.A. was a bus and coach manufacturer based in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. Tata Hispano has plants in Zaragoza, Spain, and Casablanca, Morocco. Tata Motors first acquired a 21% stake in Hispano Carrocera SA in 2005,[34] and purchased the remaining 79% for an undisclosed sum in 2009, making it a fully owned subsidiary, subsequently renamed Tata Hispano. In 2013, Tata Hispano ceased production at its Zaragoza plant.[35][36]\\n\\nTML Drivelines[edit]\\nTML Drivelines Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors engaged in the manufacture of gearboxes and axles for heavy and medium commercial vehicles.

It was acquired by TTL in August 2005 for â‚¹4 billion.\\nIn 2017, TAL, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, manufactured India\\'s first industrial articulated robot for micro, small, and medium enterprises.[36]\\n\\nEuropean Technical Centre[edit]\\nThe Tata Motors European Technical Centre (TMETC) is an automotive design, engineering, and research company based at WMG, University of Warwick on the campus of the University of Warwick in England. It was established in 2005 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. It was the joint developer of the World Truck.[37]\\nIn September 2013, it was announced that a new National Automotive Innovation Campus would be built at WMG at Warwick\\'s main campus at a cost of Â£100 million.[38][39] The initiative will be a partnership between Tata Motors, the university, and Jaguar Land Rover, with Â£30 million in funding coming from Tata Motors.[40]\\n\\nSubsidiaries[edit]\\nJaguar Land Rover[edit]\\nRange Rover (L405)\\n\\nLand Rover Defender\\nJaguar Land Rover PLC is a premium British automaker headquartered in Whitley, Coventry, United Kingdom, and has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors since June 2008, when it was acquired from Ford Motor Company of USA.[41] Its principal activity is the development, manufacture and sale of Jaguar luxury and sports cars and Land Rover premium four-wheel-drive vehicles.\\nJaguar Land Rover has two design centres and three assembly plants in the United Kingdom. Under Tata ownership, Jaguar Land Rover has launched new vehicles including the Range Rover Evoque, Jaguar F-Type, the Jaguar XE, the Jaguar XJ (X351), the second-generation Range Rover Sport, and Jaguar XF, the fourth-generation Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover Velar  and the Range Rover (L405).\\n\\nLand Rover Discovery Sport\\nJD Power, of the US, rates Land Rover and Jaguar as the two worst brands for initial quality.\\n[42] The Jaguar F-Pace made Consumer Reports February 2019 list of the 10 Least Reliable Cars. The editors cited \"electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks\" as problematic aspects.[43]\\nThe Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business. The company ruled out the possibility of a sale of JLR to another entity.[44]\\nIn July 2023, Tata announced its plans to invest Â£4 billion to build an electric car battery factory in the UK, which will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe.[45][46][47] The factory will be the company\\'s first battery production facility outside India.[47] Located in Bridgwater, Somerset, the factory will supply Jaguar Land Rover\\'s future battery electric models, including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar brands, with the potential to also supply other car manufacturers.[36] Production at the new facility is due to start in 2026.\\n\\nJoint ventures[edit]\\nTata Marcopolo[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Marcopolo bus in use in Chandigarh, India\\nTata Marcopolo is a bus-manufacturing joint venture between Tata Motors (51%) and the Brazil-based Marcopolo S.A. (49%). The joint venture manufactures and assembles fully built buses and coaches targeted at developing mass rapid transportation systems. It uses technology and expertise in chassis and aggregates from Tata Motors, and know-how in processes and systems for bodybuilding and bus body design from Marcopolo. Tata Marcopolo has launched a low-floor city bus which is widely used by transport corporations in many Indian cities. Its manufacturing facility is based in Dharwad, Karnataka State, India and Lucknow, India.\\nTata Motors is expected to buy the 49% stake held by its partner Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for â‚¹100 crore by February 2021. The subsidiary will continue with the â€˜Marcopoloâ€™ trademark for a minimum of three years with a non-compete provision in India for a corresponding period.[48]\\n\\nFiat-Tata[edit]\\nFiat-Tata is an India-based joint venture between Tata and Stellantis\\' Fiat which produces Fiat and Tata branded passenger cars, as well as engines and transmissions. Tata Motors has gained access to Fiat\\'s diesel engine and transmission technology through the joint venture.[49]\\nThe two companies formerly also had a distribution joint venture through which Fiat products were sold in India through joint Tata-Fiat dealerships.

These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India.\\nIn December 2019, Tata Motors unveiled the Nexon EV, an SUV with a 30.2KWh lithium-ion battery and a consistent range of 312Â\\xa0km on a single charge. It is also equipped with fast charging technology, which can charge the vehicle from 0% - 80% in 60 minutes.[60] With 525 units of Nexon EV sold in India last month, Tata Nexon EV[61] was the best-selling electric car in the month of April 2021 in India.\\nTata Passenger Electric Mobility is a subsidiary which produces electric cars under the brand name Tata Motors.[62]\\nList of Tata electric vehicles:\\n\\nTata Nexon EV\\nTata Tigor EV\\nTata Altroz EV\\nTata Tiago EV\\nTata Ace EV\\nTata Punch EV[63]\\nElectric Vehicle Concepts[edit]\\nTata Curvv\\nTata Avinya\\nTata EVision\\nHarrier.ev\\nSierra.ev[64]\\nDiscontinued Models[edit]\\nTata Telcoline (1988â€“2010)\\nTata Sierra (1991â€“2003)\\nTata Estate (1992â€“2000)\\nTata Sumo (1994â€“2019)\\nTata Indica (1998â€“2015)\\nTata Spacio (2000-2011)\\nTata Indigo (2002â€“2015)\\nTata Indigo Marina (2006â€“2009)\\nTata Xenon (2007â€“2018)\\nTata Sumo Grande (2008â€“2016)\\nTata Vista (2008â€“2015)\\nTata Nano (2008â€“2018)\\nTata Manza (2011â€“2016)[65]\\nTata Venture (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Aria (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Zest (2014â€“2020)\\nTata Bolt (2014â€“2019)\\nTata Hexa (2017â€“2020)\\nNotable vehicles[edit]\\nTata Nano[edit]\\n\\nTata Nano is often cited as the world\\'s most affordable car\\nThe Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at â‚¹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety[66][67] and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[68]\\n\\nTata Ace[edit]\\n\\nTata Super Ace\\nTata Ace, India\\'s first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle  (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle  segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport.\\nBy October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[69]\\nBy 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[70] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[71] Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries\\' Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.\\n\\nTata Prima[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Prima 4928.S in Assam, India\\nTata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company\\'s \\'global\\' truck. Tata Prima was the winner of the \\'Commercial Vehicle of the Year\\' at the Apollo Commercial Vehicles Awards, 2010 and 2012.\\n\\nTata 407[edit]\\n\\nA Tata 407 being used as water truck\\nThe Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[72] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales. The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.[73]\\n\\nTata Harrier[edit]\\n\\nTata Harrier\\nTata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass.

Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[10] By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100Â\\xa0hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.[11] After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).[citation needed]\\n\\nTata Indica (first generation)\\nTata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.[12]\\nIn the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo\\'s South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit,[13] a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,[14] Jaguar Land Rover.,[15][16][17][18] Hispano Carrocera,[19] and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.[20]\\nOn 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors\\' electric vehicle subsidiary.[21]\\n\\nOperations[edit]\\nTata Motors has vehicle assembly operations in India, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Spain, and South Africa.

The editors cited \"electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks\" as problematic aspects.[43]\\nThe Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business. The company ruled out the possibility of a sale of JLR to another entity.[44]\\nIn July 2023, Tata announced its plans to invest Â£4 billion to build an electric car battery factory in the UK, which will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe.[45][46][47] The factory will be the company\\'s first battery production facility outside India.[47] Located in Bridgwater, Somerset, the factory will supply Jaguar Land Rover\\'s future battery electric models, including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar brands, with the potential to also supply other car manufacturers.[36] Production at the new facility is due to start in 2026.\\n\\nJoint ventures[edit]\\nTata Marcopolo[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Marcopolo bus in use in Chandigarh, India\\nTata Marcopolo is a bus-manufacturing joint venture between Tata Motors (51%) and the Brazil-based Marcopolo S.A. (49%). The joint venture manufactures and assembles fully built buses and coaches targeted at developing mass rapid transportation systems. It uses technology and expertise in chassis and aggregates from Tata Motors, and know-how in processes and systems for bodybuilding and bus body design from Marcopolo. Tata Marcopolo has launched a low-floor city bus which is widely used by transport corporations in many Indian cities. Its manufacturing facility is based in Dharwad, Karnataka State, India and Lucknow, India.\\nTata Motors is expected to buy the 49% stake held by its partner Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for â‚¹100 crore by February 2021. The subsidiary will continue with the â€˜Marcopoloâ€™ trademark for a minimum of three years with a non-compete provision in India for a corresponding period.[48]\\n\\nFiat-Tata[edit]\\nFiat-Tata is an India-based joint venture between Tata and Stellantis\\' Fiat which produces Fiat and Tata branded passenger cars, as well as engines and transmissions. Tata Motors has gained access to Fiat\\'s diesel engine and transmission technology through the joint venture.[49]\\nThe two companies formerly also had a distribution joint venture through which Fiat products were sold in India through joint Tata-Fiat dealerships. This distribution arrangement was ended in March 2013; Fiats have since been distributed in India by Fiat Automobiles India Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat[50][51] and now Tata Motors.\\n\\nTata Hitachi Construction Machinery[edit]\\n\\nTata Hitachi Construction Machinery is a joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi which manufactures excavators and other construction equipment.[citation needed] It was previously known as Telcon Construction Solutions.[citation needed]\\n\\nTata Motors European Technical Centre[edit]\\nThe TATA Motors European Technical Centre is an automotive design, engineering, and research company.[citation needed] Company based at WMG, University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] It was established in 2005 and is wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors. It was the joint developer of the World Truck.[citation needed] In September 2013 it was announced that a new National Automotive Innovative Campus would be built at WMG at Warwick\\'s main campus at a cost of 92 million pounds.[52] The initiative will be a partnership between Tata Motors, the university, and Jaguar Land Rover, with the 30 million pounds in funding coming from Tata Motors.[53]\\n\\nHyundai-Tata[edit]\\nTata Motors and Hyundai are in a joint venture to provide  the automatic transmission for Tata Safari & Tata Harrier model.[54]\\n\\nProducts[edit]\\nFor details of Land Rover and Jaguar products, see Jaguar Land Rover.\\n\\nPassenger vehicles[edit]\\n\\nCurrent Models[edit]\\n\\n\\nModel\\n\\nYear of Introduction\\n\\n\\nHatchback\\n\\n\\nTata Tiago\\n\\n2016[55]\\n\\n\\nTata Altroz\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\nSedan\\n\\n\\nTata Tigor\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\nSUV/Crossover\\n\\n\\nTata Punch\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\nTata Nexon\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\nTata Harrier\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\nTata Safari\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\nElectric\\n\\n\\nTata Nexon EV\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\nTata Tigor EV\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\nTata Tiago EV\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\nTata Punch EV\\n\\n2023\\n\\nCommercial vehicles[edit]\\nTata Ace\\nTata Ace Zip\\nTata Ace EV\\nTata Super Ace\\nTata Intra\\nTata Intra V10\\nTata Intra V20\\nTata Intra V30\\nTata Intra V50\\nTata Xenon XT\\nTata Yodha\\nTata Ace Mega\\nTata Iris\\nTata TL/Telcoline/207 Pick-up truck\\nTata 407 Ex and Ex2\\nTata 709 Ex\\nTata 807 (Steel cabin chassis, cowl chassis, medium bus chassis, steel cabin + steel body chassis)\\nTata 809 Ex and Ex2\\nTata 909 Ex and Ex2\\nTata 1210 SE and SFC (Semi Forward)\\nTata 1210 LP (Long Plate)\\nTata 1109 (Intermediate truck/ LCV bus)\\nTata 1512c (Medium bus chassis)\\nTata 1515c/1615 (Medium bus chassis)\\nTata 1612c/1616c/1618c (Heavy bus chassis)\\nTata 1618 (Semilow-floor bus chassis)\\nTata 1623 (Rear-engined low-floor bus chassis)\\nTata 1518C (Medium truck) 10 ton\\nTata 1613/1615c (Medium truck)\\nTata 1616/1618c (Heavy duty truck)\\nTata 2515c/2516c/2518c (Heavy duty 10-wheeler truck)\\nTata Starbus (Branded buses for city, intercity, school bus, and standard passenger transportation)\\nTata Divo (Hispano Divo)\\nTata CityRide (12- to 20-seater buses for intracity use)\\nTata 3015 (Heavy truck)\\nTata 3118 (Heavy truck) (8Ã—2)\\nTata 3516 (Heavy truck)\\nTata 4018 (Heavy truck)\\nTata 4923 (Ultraheavy truck) (6Ã—4)\\nTata Novus\\nTata Prima\\nTata SIGNA series\\nTata Ultra series (ICV Segment)\\nTata Winger - (Maxivan)\\nElectric vehicles[edit]\\nTata Motors has unveiled electric versions of the Tata Indica passenger car powered by TM4 electric motors and inverters,[56] as well as the Tata Ace commercial vehicle, both of which run on lithium batteries which launched in 2022.\\nIn 2008 Tata Motors\\' UK subsidiary, Tata Motors European Technical Centre, bought a 50.3% holding in electric vehicle technology firm MiljÃ¸bil Grenland/Innovasjon of Norway for US$1.93 million, and planned to launch the electric Indica hatchback in Europe the following year.[57][58][59] In September 2010, Tata Motors presented four CNGâ€“Electric Hybrid low-floored Starbuses to the Delhi Transport Corporation, to be used during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India.\\nIn December 2019, Tata Motors unveiled the Nexon EV, an SUV with a 30.2KWh lithium-ion battery and a consistent range of 312Â\\xa0km on a single charge. It is also equipped with fast charging technology, which can charge the vehicle from 0% - 80% in 60 minutes.[60] With 525 units of Nexon EV sold in India last month, Tata Nexon EV[61] was the best-selling electric car in the month of April 2021 in India.\\nTata Passenger Electric Mobility is a subsidiary which produces electric cars under the brand name Tata Motors.[62]\\nList of Tata electric vehicles:\\n\\nTata Nexon EV\\nTata Tigor EV\\nTata Altroz EV\\nTata Tiago EV\\nTata Ace EV\\nTata Punch EV[63]\\nElectric Vehicle Concepts[edit]\\nTata Curvv\\nTata Avinya\\nTata EVision\\nHarrier.ev\\nSierra.ev[64]\\nDiscontinued Models[edit]\\nTata Telcoline (1988â€“2010)\\nTata Sierra (1991â€“2003)\\nTata Estate (1992â€“2000)\\nTata Sumo (1994â€“2019)\\nTata Indica (1998â€“2015)\\nTata Spacio (2000-2011)\\nTata Indigo (2002â€“2015)\\nTata Indigo Marina (2006â€“2009)\\nTata Xenon (2007â€“2018)\\nTata Sumo Grande (2008â€“2016)\\nTata Vista (2008â€“2015)\\nTata Nano (2008â€“2018)\\nTata Manza (2011â€“2016)[65]\\nTata Venture (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Aria (2010â€“2017)\\nTata Zest (2014â€“2020)\\nTata Bolt (2014â€“2019)\\nTata Hexa (2017â€“2020)\\nNotable vehicles[edit]\\nTata Nano[edit]\\n\\nTata Nano is often cited as the world\\'s most affordable car\\nThe Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at â‚¹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety[66][67] and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[68]\\n\\nTata Ace[edit]\\n\\nTata Super Ace\\nTata Ace, India\\'s first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle  (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle  segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport.\\nBy October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[69]\\nBy 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[70] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[71] Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries\\' Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.\\n\\nTata Prima[edit]\\n\\nA Tata Prima 4928.S in Assam, India\\nTata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company\\'s \\'global\\' truck. Tata Prima was the winner of the \\'Commercial Vehicle of the Year\\' at the Apollo Commercial Vehicles Awards, 2010 and 2012.\\n\\nTata 407[edit]\\n\\nA Tata 407 being used as water truck\\nThe Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[72] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales. The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.[73]\\n\\nTata Harrier[edit]\\n\\nTata Harrier\\nTata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass. This car uses the engine from Fiat which is a 2.0 L-4 cylinder turbocharged diesel motor and transmission from Hyundai which is a 6-speed, available in both manual and automatic. Tata Harrier is derived from the H5X Concept displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo. It was launched on 23 January 2019.[74]\\nThe car is a C-segment crossover SUV based on the OmegaArc platform, an essentially re-engineered version of the Jaguar Land Rover D8 platform.[75] A petrol variant of the Harrier is confirmed to launch in 2022â€“23.[76]\\nTata Harrier is also available in Nepal with the name H5.\\n\\nTata Nexon[edit]\\n\\nTata Nexon\\nThe Tata Nexon is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Tata Motors since 2017. It is the first crossover SUV from Tata Motors, and occupies the sub-4 metre crossover SUV segment in India.[77] The electric version of the Nexon was revealed on 19 December 2019. The Nexon EV uses components from Tata Motors\\' electric vehicle technology brand Ziptron. The electric motor produces 94.7Â\\xa0kW (127Â\\xa0hp; 129Â\\xa0PS) and 245Â\\xa0Nâ‹…m (181Â\\xa0lbfâ‹…ft) of torque and 0 - 100 under 9.9 seconds. It has a 30.2 kWh battery with an ARAI rated range of up to 312Â\\xa0km.[78]\\nThe battery can be fully charged in under 8 hours using a complimentary AC charger. It can also be charged using a 15-ampere power cable that can be used at any place with the necessary power socket. DC 25Â\\xa0kW fast charging can be used to charge the battery from 0 to 80% in 1 hour.[79]\\n\\nRestructuring[edit]\\nIn March 2024, Tata Motors announced plans to undergo a significant restructuring by splitting into two separate listed entities. This strategic move aims to enhance operational efficiencies and focus on distinct business segments. The demerger is expected to allow each entity to pursue tailored growth strategies and attract specific investor bases. The announcement was well-received by the market, with Tata Motors\\' stock experiencing a notable jump following the news.[80][81][82]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of companies of India\\nList of largest companies by revenue\\nList of corporations by market capitalisation\\nMake in India\\nForbes Global 2000\\nFortune India 500\\nAutomotive industry in India\\nTata Revotron engine\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Contact Us - Tata Motors Limited\". www.tatamotors.com. 14 October 2015.

TTMT is on track to meet its outlined operational metrics, viewing the demerger as having no impact on these objectives. TTMT expects demerger to offer greater maneuverability, aiming for both entities to operate in a self-sustaining manner. Although we see limited benefits in terms of value unlocking, TTMT's confidence reassures us of a sustainable recovery in both the India PV and JLR. We remain positive on Tata Motors based on: 1) JLR’s volume ramp-up, leading to strong revenue, profitability, and FCF; 2) a focus on increasing market share in the PV segment through model launches and rising EV penetration; and 3) profitable and robust FCF performance, driven by margin expansion in the CV segment. We have adjusted our estimates primarily for the India businesses, resulting in a consolidated EPS change of 0.4% for FY24-FY26E, with an estimated CAGR of 12.4% over the same period.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nWe have increased our EV/EBITDA multiple for the India PV business to 13x to align it more closely with Maruti Suzuki. Consequently, our SoTP-based TP has been revised upwards to Rs. 1,075. However, given the stock's sharp runup over the last three months, we are downgrading our recommendation to 'ACCUMULATE' from 'Buy'.\\n\\nFor all IPO report, click here\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nBuy Power Finance Corporation; target of Rs 475: Motilal Oswal\\n\\nBuy Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals; target of Rs 425: LKP Research\\n\\nBuy Ashok Leyland; target of Rs 266: LKP Research\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

With identical shareholding post demerger, we believe this development would help investors manage their holdings in the CV business, as per their assessment of CV cycle’s trends. This demerger, in our view, would bring to the fore the synergistic benefits within the PV domain more efficiently and help TTMT unlock further value in domestic PVs vs. valuing India CV+PVs at 10-12x EV/EBITDA – India PVs shall be valued at 15x EV/EBITDA, 10% discount to MSIL, pushing up overall valuation by ~6%.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement\\n\\nRemove Ad\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nWe downgrade TTMT to REDUCE from Hold, post its ~40% rally in past three months, with an SoTP-based TP of INR 901 (implying ~13x/2.5x FY26E India/JLR EV/EBITDA).\\n\\nFor all recommendations report, click here\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nBuy Power Finance Corporation; target of Rs 475: Motilal Oswal\\n\\nBuy Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals; target of Rs 425: LKP Research\\n\\nBuy Ashok Leyland; target of Rs 266: LKP Research\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
